Another reason for building this model or having this knowledge was that it could be useful. Lets say that you just inheritated a diamond and no nothing about diamond specifics like most people. You can try and look online for a price evaluation however there isnt a good model on evaluating them or accurate results across multipe sites. You could also take it to a pawn shop where they will lowball you and cheat you out of your money. Taking it to a jewlery store is always your best option."
